1:39fe224:  * {@code f(0) = sqrt(ab)}. The linear mapping is useful for values that must stay roughly within a range but
1:39fe224:  * which are roughly uniform within the center of that range. The exponential
1:39fe224:  * mapping is useful for values that must stay within a range but whose distribution is roughly exponential near
1:39fe224:  * geometric mean of the end-points.  An identity mapping is also supplied.</p>
